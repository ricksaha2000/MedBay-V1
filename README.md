## Inspiration

The global COVID-19 pandemic has introduced massive changes in both need and availability of telemedicine and telehealth services. Physicians have increased their use of telemedicine to care for individuals and populations who have difficulty accessing care because of geography, lack of available trained practitioners, or health limitations. If we can provide an application which would help in handling mental fitness, heart-rate monitoring and also a smart chatbot to be aware of symptoms and diseases and doctors needed to consult, then it would be highly beneficiary to the generation especially in this pandemic world. The motivation behind this idea was driven by wellness for the entire society in these times. People fret about their pulse or heartrate considering as a symptom for COVID, they suffer from anxiety or depression. They are unaware or worried about what symptoms would prompt what disease and which doctor to consult. Also a medical platform to order medicines online through a voice based chatbot would benefit the older generation as well. Hence, our application MEDBAY-V1 comes to the rescue providing a one stop for all.
